### Team Name: [Catalysts]

### Project Description
üïØÔ∏è Blowify ‚Äì A Fun and Useless React App

Blow into your mic to extinguish a candle of a particular threshold, flip a coin, scratch a card, and reveal a random funny YouTube video by scanning the QR code or navigate by the link provided. A beautifully pointless journey made with React.



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Ever sat down and thought,
"Why can‚Äôt I just blow on my mic and end up watching a meme video through a scratch card... via a coin flip... after extinguishing a virtual candle?"

Yeah, we didn‚Äôt think so either. But we made it anyway.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Blowify is a ridiculous, over-engineered React app that creates a hilariously useless chain of events:

1.Blow into your mic to extinguish a virtual candle

2.Toss a coin (cross your fingers for HEADS!)

3.Scratch a card for the mystery surprise

4.Unlock a random funny YouTube video by scanning a QR 

It‚Äôs interactive. It‚Äôs unpredictable. It‚Äôs pointless perfection.]
